# Maintenance Branch   
As a SQL DBA, I have tried multiple ways to implement the index and statistics maintenance using different scripts. As most of the SQL community knows that ola.hallengren provides most of the required feature and effective way to do it.
As I have to implement across 500+ SQL Servers and need to monitor it, I have create the below scripts to create maintenance jobs with steps for each database. This help us to star the job from the failed steps and easy to monitor status using CMS across all the 500+ SQL Servers.
